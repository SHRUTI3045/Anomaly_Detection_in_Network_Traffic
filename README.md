# Anomaly Detection in Network Traffic 🚨

This project implements a machine learning-based approach to detect anomalies in network traffic, which can help in identifying potential cyber threats and unusual patterns. It aims to strengthen network security by distinguishing between normal and suspicious activities using data-driven techniques.

## 📁 Dataset

We used the **KDD Cup 1999** dataset, a widely-used benchmark for intrusion detection systems.

- [KDD Dataset Info](http://kdd.ics.uci.edu/databases/kddcup99/kddcup99.html)

## 🧠 Techniques Used

- **Preprocessing**:
  - Label encoding for categorical features
  - Feature scaling (e.g., MinMaxScaler)
  - Handling class imbalance

- **Machine Learning Algorithms**:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Random Forest
  - Decision Tree
  - Naive Bayes
  - Support Vector Machine (SVM)

- **Evaluation Metrics**:
  - Accuracy
  - Precision
  - Recall
  - F1-Score

*(Evaluation results are visible in the notebook outputs.)*
